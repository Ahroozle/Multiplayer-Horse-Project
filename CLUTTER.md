# General Information Clutter File

This file is here to keep README.md from becoming cluttered with assorted thoughts, ideas, etc. and to keep things from looking generally like a mess out front.

### Current Design Thoughts

Assorted design thoughts that may or may not make it into the project.

#### Likely Inclusions

##### Macro-scale Environment Manipulation

This was more or less based off of a passing daydream, although the way my current procedural world generation is panning out, I'm thinking this won't be _as_ bad of a thing to implement as I originally thought.

Imagine for a second that you are in a flying castle dungeon, and once you have killed the boss, the castle begins to collapse and fall to the ground. This is what I would consider the designed route of this scenario, the one which _I_ scripted and intended. However, what if I added a way to allow the players to _save_ the castle? Maybe even be able to use it as a home base given certain circumstances?

This is what I mean in terms of "Macro-scale Environment Manipulation" (although the words are probably way, _way_ off). Both being able to:
1. Construct scripted, possibly gargantuan events that can happen during gameplay
and
2. Giving players the tools to make their own absurd, awesome events through the gameplay they already can understand.

To get these results I intend to make more of an "ecosystem" of sorts, based off of rules that interact with each other in a meaningful, player-visible way that can be used to make all manners of systems without being bound to one particular situation.

This, of course, both sounds like and most likely _is_ a tall order. I'll do the best I can, but something is probably going to buckle.

#### Indecisive due to current phase of development

(I'll add to this section later. It's actually 4 AM right now.)

### Inspirations

Assorted inspirations have gone into building up the ideas that will eventually make up the gameplay of this game.

Among them are:

- Games
	- Paper Mario / The Thousand Year Door
	- Xenoblade Chronicles / X
	- Terraria
	- [PonyTown](https://pony.town/) \(if that wasn't already apparent)
- Other Media
	- Homestuck

This list is very likely going to grow as I consume more media and consider more of their ideas and design, as well as remember other inspirations that I'd forgotten.
