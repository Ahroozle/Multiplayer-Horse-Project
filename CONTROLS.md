# Controls

- WASD for movement
- Space Bar to jump
	- If you're a pegasus you can press space in midair to "flap", which functions identically to a jump in midair. You can perform several flaps based on various factors but the default is three at most.
- Enter to bring up the quick chat. This pops a box into the bottom left corner and automatically focuses your keyboard on it. Pressing enter while focused on the box causes it to fade back out and send any messages you've typed.
- Left Shift : Combination button for special mechanics
	- If you're a unicorn when you use this, it brings up your magic menu, where you can then left click on any spells you have equipped (up to 4) to begin casting them.
- Left Click : Interaction with assorted things
	- During spellcasting, left click is used to select focii for spells, i.e. who or what to cast things on, what location to move something to, etc.
- Right Click : Interaction with assorted things:
	- During spellcasting, right click is used to cancel a spell in case the need arises.
- P : "Pause"
	-This brings up the "pause" menu, which will eventually contain things like the inventory, options, exiting from a session, etc.

Temporary / In-production controls:

- Left Control : "Unlocks" the camera
	- This is just here while I deal with other things as a simple, crappy "fix" for dealing with the camera. Holding both Left Control and the Right Mouse Button down while moving the mouse left or right allows the angle of the camera to be changed, while holding Left Control and scrolling with the mouse wheel allows for zooming the camera out/in.
- Tab : Switches camera following styles.
	- By default the camera operates in the "paper mario" style, i.e. the camera stays the same height as the last ground the player stood on, and readjusts when the player is standing on new ground. Pressing tab toggles between this style and a different one where the camera always follows the player exactly regardless of their height, and also positions the camera between the player's position and the mouse's, allowing them to see further in the direction in which the mouse is pointed. Eventually this will be replaced by only one type of camera movement which may be either of them or a combination of qualities from both. Only time will tell what it'll end up being.
