# Multiplayer Horse Project

This is an independent project I'm currently doing in my spare time as a way to deepen my understanding of unreal, as well as test out some ideas I have lying around in game format.

This project is being created in Unreal 4.15.2 (from source) exclusively, to maintain a stable development environment.

It is currently in a state that supports online multiplayer (listen servers only, dedi support on the way), however I recommend against playing with larger amounts of players as, due to how Unreal manages its character replication, the session will begin to become very laggy.
